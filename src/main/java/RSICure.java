         * every situation. While it isn't necessary to use an ide, as the original
         * argument stated, "Haven't we ALREADY PROVED that the CPU can do all the work
         * in making things easy for us, the user, A LONG TIME AGO?!?". Most IDEs
         * come with hot-keys to generate 90% of the boilerplate code for us.
         *
         * Why type it out manually, when you can have your machine do it for you?
         * None the less, why not have the best of both worlds? VIM plugins will
         * allow your IDE to emulate vim while allowing you too keep all the bonus
         * features of using an IDE.
