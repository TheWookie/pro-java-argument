Don't get me wrong, java has its faults. I do think, however, that they should be pointed out and should actually be evaluated instead of presenting slander with little evidence to why the language has faults.

More-over, I once read an article showing that people who were more prone to complaining instead of just finding a way to accomplish their goal were less likely to be good problem solvers (link: http://www.thousandtyone.com/blog/EasierThanFizzBuzzWhyCantProgrammersPrint100To1.aspx). Correlation is not causation, nor am I accusing Jonathan Gardner of overly complaining, but I do think that it is popular to bash java with little or no evidence as to what is wrong with it (I have my list, but it is not comprehensive. When it is matured, I will unleash it's might against the populaces where it will be swiftly burried and ignored.)
